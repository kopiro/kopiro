It was 4 years ago when I had the idea to replicate the Apple¬Æ Siri wave-form (introduced with the iPhone 4S) in the browser using pure Javascript.

During the last month, I updated this library by doing a lot of refactoring using ES6 features and reviewed the build process using **RollupJS**. Now I‚Äôve decided to share what I've learned during this process and the math behind this library.

To get an idea of what the output will be, visit the [live example](http://kopiro.github.io/siriwave/); the whole codebase is [here](https://github.com/kopiro/siriwave).

Additionally, you can download all plots drawn in this article in GCX (OSX Grapher format): [default.gcx](https://github.com/kopiro/siriwave/raw/master/etc/gcx/default.gcx) and [ios9.gcx](https://github.com/kopiro/siriwave/raw/master/etc/gcx/ios9.gcx)

## The classic wave style

![Classic style](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2380/1*60NI4dQ3KgGxAm7SJSUQww.gif)

Initially, this library only had the classic wave-form style that all of you remember using in iOS 7 and iOS 8.

It‚Äôs no hard task to replicate this simple wave-form, only a bit of math and basic concepts of the Canvas API.

![Siri wave-form in iOS 7/8](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*1FuKVf3OEMhJq8zq.jpg)

You‚Äôre probably thinking that the wave-form is a modification of the **Sine** math equation, and you're right... well, almost right.

Before starting to code, we‚Äôve got to find our linear equation that will be simply applied afterward. My favorite plot editor is **Grapher;** you can find it in any OSX installation under *Applications > Utilities > Grapher.app*

We start by drawing the well known `sin(x)`:

![Plot for y = sin(x)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*P_POqjjTsJSRbd1yXhU4OQ.png)

Perfecto! Now, let‚Äôs add some parameters (Amplitude `[A]`, Time coordinate `[t]` and Spatial frequency `[k]`) that will be useful later (Read more at: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave)).

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/346/1*bub3URu32khRadkhU-WvOw.png)

Now we have to ‚Äúattenuate‚Äù this function on plot boundaries, so that for `|x| > 2`, the `y` values tends to 0. Let‚Äôs draw separately an equation `g(x)` that has these characteristics.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ODjpbIr835U5NvW3MpetTw.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Zsl7m01QLtcwwrj8icJ2dw.png)

This seems to be a good equation to start with. Let‚Äôs add some parameters here too to smooth the curve for our purposes:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*nQ0Eu0V9YxnXNWeT7B66-g.png)

Now, by multiplying our `f(x, ‚Ä¶)` and `g(x, ‚Ä¶)`, and by setting precise parameters to the other static values, we obtain something like this.

* `A = 0.9` set the amplitude of the wave to max Y = A

* `k = 8` set the spatial frequency and we obtain ‚Äúmore peaks‚Äù in the range [-2, 2]

* `t = -œÄ/2` set the phase translation so that `f(0, ‚Ä¶) = 1`

* `K = 4` set the factor for the ‚Äúattenuation equation‚Äù so that the final equation is y = 0 when `|x| ‚â• 2`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PpPTyzlE1R1WBHRorp9wNA.png)

It looks good! üòç

Now, if you notice on the original wave we have other sub-waves that will give a lower value for the amplitude. Let‚Äôs draw them for `A = {0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8}`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Vf8LFJTkLtk5NWifl4D_8w.png)

In the final canvas composition, the sub-waves will be drawn with a decreasing opacity tending to `0`.

### Basic code concepts

What do we do now with this equation?

We use the equation to obtain the **Y value** for an **input X**.

Basically, by using a simple **for loop** from `-2 to 2` (the *plot boundaries in this case*), we have to draw **point by point** the equation on the canvas using the [beginPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/beginPath) and [lineTo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineTo) API.

```js
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.strokeStyle = 'white';
    
for (let i = -2; i <= 2; i += 0.01) {
   const x = _xpos(i);
   const y = _ypos(i);
   ctx.lineTo(x, y);
}
    
ctx.stroke();
```

Probably this pseudo-code will clear up these ideas. We still have to implement our `_xpos` and `_ypos` functions.

But‚Ä¶ hey, what is `0.01`???

That value represents **how many pixels** you move forward in each iteration before reaching the right plot boundary... but why 0.0.1, and what is the correct value?

If you use a really small value (`< 0.01`), you‚Äôll get an insanely precise rendering of the graph but your performance will decrease because you‚Äôll get too many iterations.

Instead, if you use a really big value (`> 0.1`) your graph will lose precision and you‚Äôll notice this instantly.

![Plot drawn with precision = 0.2](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*F9vtajOYHMBnd47FtuCcBQ.png)

You can see that the final code is actually similar to the pseudo-code: [https://github.com/kopiro/siriwave/blob/master/src/curve.ts](https://github.com/kopiro/siriwave/blob/master/src/curve.ts)

### Implement `_xpos(i)`

You may argue that if we‚Äôre drawing the plot by incrementing the `x`, then `_xpos` may simply return the input argument.

This is almost correct, but our plot is always drawn from `-B` to `B` (`B = Boundary = 2`).

So, to draw on the canvas via **pixel coordinates**, we must translate `-B to 0` and `B to 1` (simple transposition of [-B, B] to [0,1]); then multiply [0,1] and the **canvas width (w)**.

```
_xpos(i) = w * [ (i + B) / 2B ]
```

### Implement `_ypos`

To implement `_ypos`, we should simply write our equation obtained before (closely).

```js
const K = 4;
const FREQ = 6;

function _attFn(x) {
    return Math.pow(K / (K + Math.pow(x, K)), K);
}

function _ypos(i) {
    return Math.sin(FREQ * i - phase) * 
        _attFn(i) * 
        canvasHeight *
        globalAmplitude * 
        (1 / attenuation);
}
```

Let‚Äôs clarify some parameters.

* `canvasHeight` is Canvas height expressed in PX

* `i` is our input value (the X)

* `phase` is the most important parameter, let‚Äôs discuss it later

* `globalAmplitude` is a static parameter that represents the amplitude of the total wave (composed by sub-waves)

* `attenuation` is a static parameter that changes for each line and represents the amplitude of a wave

### Phase

Now let‚Äôs discuss the **phase variable**: it is the **first changing variable** over time because it simulates the wave movement.

What does it mean? It means that **for each** animation frame, our base controller should **increment** this value. But to avoid this value throwing a buffer overflow, let‚Äôs modulo it with 2œÄ (since `Math.sin` dominio is already modulo 2œÄ).

```js
phase = (phase + (Math.PI / 2) * speed) % (2 * Math.PI);
```

We multiply `speed` and `Math.PI` so that with `speed = 1`  we have the maximum speed (why? because `sin(0) = 0, sin(œÄ/2) = 1, sin(œÄ) = 0, ...`.

### Finalizing

Now that we have all code to draw a single line, we define a configuration array to draw all sub-waves and then cycle over them.

```js
return [
    { attenuation: -2, lineWidth: 1.0, opacity: 0.1 },
    { attenuation: -6, lineWidth: 1.0, opacity: 0.2 },
    { attenuation: 4, lineWidth: 1.0, opacity: 0.4 },
    { attenuation: 2, lineWidth: 1.0, opacity: 0.6},

    // basic line
    { attenuation: 1, lineWidth: 1.5, opacity: 1.0},
];
```

## The iOS 9+ style

![GIF of SiriwaveJS iOS9+](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2392/1*yXia5olaPzgiWmTLtK15dQ.gif)

Now things start to get complicated. The style introduced with iOS 9 is really complex and reverse engineering to simulate it‚Äôs not easy at all! I‚Äôm not fully satisfied with the final result, but I‚Äôll continue to improve it until I get the desired result.

As previously done, let‚Äôs start to obtain the linear equations of the waves.

![Original Siri iOS 9+ wave-form](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RxQeKt8kr44BGOiglmf6-A.png)

As you can notice:

* We have three **different specular equations** with different colors (**green, blue, red**)

* A single wave seems to be a **sum of sine equations** with **different parameters**

* All other colors are a **composition** of these three base colors

* There is a **straight line **at the plot boundaries

By picking again our previous equations, let‚Äôs define a more complex equation that **involves translation**. We start by defining again our attenuation equation:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IW7BD0ES7gB_i5_jXFK1yw.png)

Now, define `h(x, A, k, t)` function, that is the sine function **multiplied for **attenuation function**, in its absolute value:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YJVEyZWAK5a0Wo-DEnX42Q.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8-Q9mONQMLe8XY96Sh5gFg.png)

We now have a powerful tool.

With `h(x)`, we can now create the final wave-form by summing different **h(x)** with different parameters involving different amplitudes, frequency, and translations. For example, let‚Äôs define the **red curve ** by putting random values.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8H7pGIkpTN5MVv01AqHOnw.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2590/1*QO-3MLlKAZDxX-yKWUp5QQ.png)

If we do the same with a **green** and **blue** curve, this is the result:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*N2tzkw5l3tGsXFFpVEBgBQ.png)

This is not quite perfect, but it could work.

To obtain the specular version, just multiply everything by `-1`.

In the coding side, the approach is the same, we have only a more complex equation for `_ypos`.

```js
const K = 4;
const NO_OF_CURVES = 3;

// This parameters should be generated randomly
const widths = [ 0.4, 0.6, 0.3 ];
const offsets = [ 1, 4, -3 ];
const amplitudes = [ 0.5, 0.7, 0.2 ];
const phases = [ 0, 0, 0 ];

function _globalAttFn(x) {
    return Math.pow(K / (K + Math.pow(x, 2)), K);
}

function _ypos(i) {
    let y = 0;
    for (let ci = 0; ci < NO_OF_CURVES; ci++) {
        const t = offsets[ci];
        const k = 1 / widths[ci];
        const x = (i * k) - t;
        
        y += Math.abs(
            amplitudes[ci] * 
            Math.sin(x - phases[ci]) * 
            _globalAttFn(x)
        );
    }

    y = y / NO_OF_CURVES;
    return canvasHeightMax * globalAmplitude * y;
}
```

There‚Äôs nothing complex here. The only thing that changed is that we cycle `NO_OF_CURVES` times overall pseudo-random parameters and we **sum** all **y values**.

Before multiplying it for `canvasHeightMax` and  `globalAmplitude` that give us the absolute PX coordinate of the canvas, we divide it for `NO_OF_CURVES` so that **y is always ‚â§ 1**.

### Composite operation

One thing that actually matters here is the `globalCompositeOperation` mode to set in the Canvas. If you notice, in the original controller, when there‚Äôs an overlap of 2+ colors, they‚Äôre actually mixed in a standard way.

The default is set to `source-over`, but the result is poor, even with an opacity set.

![composite operation: source-over](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wlFF6gwTfbz324uhSuYaOg.png)

You can see all examples of vary **globalCompositeOperation **here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation)

By setting `globalCompositeOperation` to `ligther`, you notice that the intersection of the colors is nearest to the original.

## Build with RollupJS

Before refactoring everything, I wasn‚Äôt satisfied at all with the codebase: old prototype-like classes, a single Javascript file for everything, no uglify/minify and **no build at all**.

Using the new ES6 feature like **native classes, spread operators** and **lambda functions**, I was able to clean everything, split files, and decrease lines of unnecessary code.

Furthermore, I used [RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/) to create a transpiled and minified build in various formats.

Since this is a browser-only library, I decided to create two builds: a **UMD (Universal Module Definition)** build that you can use directly by importing the script or by using CDN, and another one as an **ESM module**.

The UMD module is built with this configuration:

```js
{
    input: 'src/siriwave.js',
    output: {
        file: pkg.unpkg,
        name: pkg.amdName,
        format: 'umd'
    },
    plugins: [
        resolve(),
        commonjs(),
        babel({ exclude: 'node_modules/**' }),
    ]
}
```

An additional **minified UMD module **is built with this configuration:

```js
{
    input: 'src/siriwave.js',
    output: {
        file: pkg.unpkg**.replace('.js', '.min.js')**,
        name: pkg.amdName,
        format: 'umd'
    },
    plugins: [
        resolve(),
        commonjs(),
        babel({ exclude: 'node_modules/**' }),
        **uglify()**
    ]
}
```

Benefiting of UnPKG service, you can find the final build on this URL served by a CDN: [https://unpkg.com/siriwave/dist/siriwave.min.js](https://unpkg.com/siriwave/dist/siriwave.min.js)

This is the ‚Äúold style Javascript way‚Äù ‚Äî you can just import your script and then refer in your code by using `SiriWave` global object.

To provide a more elegant and modern way, I also built an ESM module with this configuration:

```js
{ 
    input: 'src/siriwave.js',
    output: { 
        file: pkg.module, 
        format: 'esm'
    }, 
    plugins: [ 
        babel({ exclude: ‚Äònode_modules/**‚Äô })
    ]
}
```

We clearly don‚Äôt want the **resolve **or **commonjs** RollupJS plugins because the developer transplier will resolve dependencies for us.

You can find the final RollupJS configuration here: [https://github.com/kopiro/siriwave/blob/master/rollup.config.js](https://github.com/kopiro/siriwave/blob/master/rollup.config.js)

### Watch and Hot code reload

Using RollupJS, you can also take advantage of `rollup-plugin-livereload` and `rollup-plugin-serve` plugins to provide a better way to work on scripts.

Basically, you just add these plugins when you‚Äôre in ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù mode:

```js
import livereload from 'rollup-plugin-livereload';
import serve from 'rollup-plugin-serve';

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    additional_plugins.push(serve({ open: true, contentBase: '.' }));
    additional_plugins.push(livereload({ watch: 'dist' }));
}
```

We finish by adding these lines into the **package.json:**

```js
"module": "dist/siriwave.m.js",
"jsnext:main": "dist/siriwave.m.js",
"unpkg": "dist/siriwave.js",
"amdName": "SiriWave",
"scripts": {
    "build": "NODE_ENV=production rollup -c",
    "dev": "rollup -c -w"
},
```

Let‚Äôs clarify some parameters:

* `module / jsnext:main` - path of dist ESM module

* `unpkg` - path of dist UMD module

* `amdName` name of the global object in UMD module

Thanks a lot **RollupJS!**

Hope that you find this article interesting, see you soon! üòé
