I’m quite sure there is a similar concept in Android, but since I own an iPhone I’ll describe the procedure for this one.\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/c56ulsht6ffzo7fgaxmv.jpeg)\n\n### Connect the servo\n\nThat's pretty straightforward; your servo motor should have 3 pins: 3V, GROUND, and the controller pin.\n\nConnect these to your board, choose the controller pin and write it down; if you have a NodeMCU and the HXT900, you can use this schema:\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4ap1cn6qk9yth37xvmvr.png)\n\n### Download the sketch and flash it\n\nDownload this sketch: https://github.com/kopiro/arduino/blob/main/Projects/ButtonPresser/ButtonPresser.ino to your workstation and open it.\n\nI'm not gonna cover here how to configure your workstation on how to build Arduino sketches or how to install ESP8266 drivers, as you can find all resources [here](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266).\n\nBefore flashing it, you should modify the sketch and set `WIFI_ENABLED` to `1`, `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS` to reflect your network configuration, so that the board is able to connect to it.\n\nAlso, make sure you set the `MDNS_ENABLED` to `1`, and `MDNS_NAME` to something that makes sense for you; this is how you can reach your board in your network without dealing with static DHCP IP allocation on your router.\n\nMake sure you also change the `SERVO_GPIO` to be the GPIO number where you have connected your servo controller pin.\n\nIf you want to make sure you can update the board via OTA (over-the-air; without connecting the board via USB to the workstation), please also set `OTA_ENABLED` to 1 and set the `OTA_PASS` to something unique.\n\nOnce you have flashed your board, it should be accessible via the `MDNS_NAME` you choose in your browser.\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dxd69zq3o8av7dpe53tk.png)\n\nThis is a simple dashboard where you can play with the software to choose the right values based on your coffee machine, on how long, how far, and how many times the button should be pressed.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n* `degree` is a numeric value representing how many degrees the servo should turn. If you have put the button at 0 degree, something between 20 and 45 should do the job to press a button.\n* `delay` is the number of milliseconds the board should wait before lifting the servo back and turning it again to `0`\n* `times` is how many times this “push” button operation should be repeated. This is quite useful in my case because I have to press once to switch on the coffee machine and twice to actually pour the coffee.\n* `delaytimes` is the number of milliseconds to wait between every “push” button operation\n\nPlay with these values until you are sure that the coffee machine is able to press the button properly, and store them for later.\n\n### What the sketch is really doing\n\nNothing fancy, actually.\n\nIt's simple exposing an HTTP server with a POST method called `/api` that accepts those parameters you played with before; when you hit this endpoint, it will simply turn the servo by the `degree` parameter specified.\n\n```c\nconst String method = server.arg(\"method\");\nint _degree = server.arg(\"degree\").toInt();\nint _delay = server.arg(\"delay\").toInt();\nint _times = server.arg(\"times\").toInt();\nint _delaytimes = server.arg(\"delaytimes\").toInt();\n\nif (method.equals(\"push\")) {\n  if (!_degree) _degree = 45;\n  if (!_delay) _delay = 200;\n  if (!_times) _times = 1;\n  if (!_delaytimes) _delaytimes = 1000;\n\n  for (int i = 0; i < _times; i++) {\n    myservo.write(_degree);\n    delay(_delay);\n    myservo.write(0);\n    if ((i + 1) != _times) {\n      delay(_delaytimes);\n    }\n  }\n\n  server.send(200, \"text/plain\", \"OK\");\n  return;\n}\n```\n\nIf you make a request using cURL to that endpoint, you can test from your terminal:\n\n```sh\ncurl http://buttonpresser.local/api -X POST --data \"method=push&degree=20&times=2\"\n```\n\n### Make coffee every morning after you have stopped your alarm\n\nThis is the simplest and funniest part; we’re gonna just take advantage of the *“Shortcut”* app already available on your iOS device.\n\nCreate a new shortcut with the action of *”Get Contents of URL”* and put these values:\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/27oyltgsmftqkvi1iqez.jpeg)\n\nYou can now test this shortcut by saying to Siri, or just by pressing the button.\n\nHow to do the automation though?\n\nThat’s even simpler, go to the *Automation* tab, and select *When my alarm has stopped* > *Run shortcut* and select the shortcut you’ve previously created!\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/q8c4h94wr802fmmr79ol.png)\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/7mj1xbxbm4kjlrm64ob1.png)\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/17aq3laeklk14pezigxb.png)\n\nThat’s all, for real... Happy morning coffee!\n\n{% twitter 1350822814857777157 %}\n\n\n\n\n",
