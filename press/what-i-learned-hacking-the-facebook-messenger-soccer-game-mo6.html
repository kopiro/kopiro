<h4 id="published-on-2020-july-30th">Published on 2020, July 30th</h4>
<p>Recently, during the last European Football Championship, Facebook introduced a little game in the Messenger app that makes you lose hours and hours despite its simplicity.</p>
<p>If you didn’t notice it, read <a href="https://mashable.com/2016/06/15/facebook-messenger-soccer-game-how-to/#fmGutFmQ3Oqx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this article</a> on Mashable.</p>
<p>I have to admit… I totally suck at this game, so my best score was <strong>9</strong>.</p>
<p>But, as a Developer, the best thing I could do was to beat my friends by hacking the game.</p>
<p><em>I really thought this would be simple.</em></p>
<h3 id="first-way-listen-to-https-requests">First way: Listen to HTTP(s) requests</h3>
<p>While developing apps, you immediately realize that you need an HTTP debugger tool to analyze incoming /outgoing traffic for your APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charles</a> is the best tool I’ve found to accomplish this task. It has a very intuitive interface and you can easily use it for debugging and reverse engineering purposes.</p>
<p>It was supposed to end at this point: I would have to analyze the API that the Facebook app used and just replay it with CURL while editing the data and the score sent to the server.</p>
<p>Of course, the API calls are in HTTPS, so they’re encrypted.. but Charles can be used as a man-in-the-middle HTTPS proxy, * enabling you to view in plain text the communication between a web browser and SSL web server.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2564/1*rHRhqfl0hZSYHdEsrJLF_A.png" alt="Charles acting as a proxy — with failed requests" /></p>
<p>Perfect! So I installed the root Charles certificate on the iPhone, and I tried to inspect the traffic; but all HTTP calls to the Facebook servers were denied upfront during the SSL handshake phase.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Mjd0P2T-huqFhck7Ii3alA.gif" alt="SSL - image courtesy of cisco.com" /></p>
<p>Doing some research, I discovered that some company apps like Facebook and Google use an extra layer of security to ensure that the certificate provided by the remote server is the one that is expected; this technique is called <strong>Certificate Pinning</strong>.</p>
<p>You can easily do this by including the public key of the remote server certificate within the application so that it’s easy to validate the identity of the client for each HTTPS request.</p>
<p>This technique invalidates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Man in the Middle (MITM)</a> Attack.</p>
<p>Great job Facebook! But…(remember, there’s always a but) there is a way to disable the <strong>SSL certificate pinning</strong> using some system tweaks only available on a jailbroken device.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-way-enhanced-jailbreak-a-device-and-install-ios-ssl-kill-switch">The first way (enhanced): Jailbreak a device and install iOS SSL Kill Switch</h3>
<p>My iPhone is currently running iOS 9.x, so at the time of this writing, it was impossible to jailbreak. So I took an old iPad mini running iOS 8.3.x and easily jailbroke it using the <a href="http://www.taig.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TaiG</a> tool.</p>
<p>Searching on the web, I found <a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SSL Kill Switch 2</a>, a Blackbox tool to disable SSL certificate validation within iOS and OS X apps.</p>
<p>Once loaded into an iOS or OS X App, SSL Kill Switch 2 patches specific low-level SSL functions within the Secure Transport API in order to <em>override, and disable the system’s default certificate validation as well as any kind of custom certificate validation</em> (such as certificate pinning).</p>
<p>The SSL Kill Switch uses <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/MobileSubstrate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MobileSubstrate</a> to patch system functions like the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/Security/Reference/secureTransportRef/Reference/reference.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Secure Transport API</a>. They are the lowest-level TLS implementation on iOS.</p>
<p>This means that disabling SSL certificate validation in the Secure Transport API should affect most (if not all) of the network APIs available within the iOS framework.</p>
<p>Please, do yourself a favor and follow <a href="https://nabla-c0d3.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this blog</a> that covers all these concepts.</p>
<p>So, I connected to the iPad using SSH and installed the package:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">wget [https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2/releases/download/0.10/com.nablac0d3.SSLKillSwitch2_0.10.deb](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2/releases/download/0.10/com.nablac0d3.SSLKillSwitch2_0.10.deb) --no-check-certificate
dpkg -i [com.nablac0d3.SSLKillSwitch2_0.10.deb](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2/releases/download/0.10/com.nablac0d3.SSLKillSwitch2_0.10.deb)
killall -HUP SpringBoard</code></pre>
<p>Once rebooted, I expected to see the plain traffic, but it was an optimistic vision: <em>I got the same errors.</em></p>
<p>I tried this way for another hour. I read somewhere that Facebook and Twitter use the SPDY protocol for their API calls, and this could be a problem for Charles. So I installed another tweak that (theoretically) disabled the SPDY protocol, but it didn’t work.</p>
<p><em>Starving.</em></p>
<p>Looking at the project issues, I noticed that someone else had the same problem (<a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2/issues/13" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2/issues/13</a>), with no resolution.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*UlNOgv5rpOId_yvnggV3hQ.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<h3 id="second-way-simulate-touch-events-within-the-application">Second way: simulate touch events within the application</h3>
<p>I realized that there are many game cheats that use a “human” approach: <em>simulate touch events</em> (one of the most popular games that many game cheats utilize this strategy on is Clash of Clans).</p>
<p>Browsing the web for a tool that automates these operations, I found this awesome tweak - <a href="https://autotouch.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AutoTouch</a>. It can record human touch events and store the data in a LUA script. You can then edit this produced script and simulate whatever you want anywhere on your device.</p>
<p>Once installed with <a href="https://cydia.saurik.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cydia</a>, I saved a BMP screenshot of the Messenger application with the ball visible and obtained the coordinates of where to click.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*inmRf5q2zYXB4IAMZYvwrw.png" alt="Screenshot made to obtain the coordinate" /><em>Screenshot made to obtain the coordinate</em></p>
<p>What I thought is that, by clicking <em>exactly</em> in the center of the x-axis of the ball, I only had to simulate repetitive touch events in the same coordinates and then stop the script when I had a score that I was satisfied with.</p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote to accomplish this goal:</p>
<pre><code>    adaptResolution(768, 1024);
    adaptOrientation(ORIENTATION_TYPE.PORTRAIT);

    for i=1,2000 do

      touchDown(1, 544, 954);
      usleep(66000);
      touchUp(1, 544, 954);

      usleep(10000);

    end</code></pre>
<p>Nope, it didn’t work.</p>
<p>Probably, Facebook developers introduced a random error on touch coordinates to better simulate the game, or to prevent these type of scripts.</p>
<p><em>Or, maybe I just clicked at the wrong pixel.</em></p>
<p>So, for a second chance, I tried to simulate multiple clicks in a larger area, but without luck. Sometimes, I simulated so many touch events that the Springboard *just crashed *because of memory errors<em>.</em></p>
<p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Dx5XVmM2NI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p>Instead of clicking on the same coordinates every time, I tried a better approach.</p>
<p>Reading the AutoTouch <a href="https://autotouch.net/server/doc/en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documentation</a>, I found the following two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>findColor (color, count, region) - Search the coordinates of the pixel points matching the specified color on the current screen.</p></li>
<li><p>getColor (x, y) - Get the color value of the pixel point of the specified coordinate on the current screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea was to find a unique color inside the ball and use the <em>findColor</em> method to get the coordinates of the ball at that moment, to simulate a touch event.</p>
<pre><code>    adaptResolution(768, 1024);
    adaptOrientation(ORIENTATION_TYPE.PORTRAIT);

    local c = getColor(544, 954);

    for i=1,2000 do
      local r = findColor(c, 0, {400, 500, 768, 1024});

      for i, v in pairs(r) do
        touchDown(1, v[1], v[2]);
        usleep(66000);
        touchUp(1, v[1], v[2]);
        usleep(10000);
      end

    end</code></pre>
<p>I don’t know why, but it simply didn’t work. Maybe the <em>findColor</em> is too slow to intercept the ball, which then makes the script useless.</p>
<h3 id="third-way-reverse-engineer-the-app">Third way: Reverse engineer the app</h3>
<p>I don’t have good native skills in Objective C, but I remember (when I played with the jailbreak ~4 years ago) that there was a tool by <a href="https://twitter.com/saurik?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Saurik</a> that could inject itself into iOS processes.</p>
<p>It is released along with Cydia and was called <a href="http://www.cycript.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cycript</a>. It allowed developers to explore and modify running applications on iOS, by injecting code at run time.</p>
<p>I read some basic tutorials on how to use it, and after a few struggles, I decided to follow this (another) way.</p>
<p>Once you login via SSH into your iOS device, you can easily attach to a process just by typing:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">cycript -p Messenger</code></pre>
<p>I tried to inspect some basic UI classes like <em>UIApp</em>, but didn’t find anything interesting. Then I made a complete <strong>class dump</strong>, filtering it for the keyword <strong>soccer.</strong></p>
<pre><code class="objective-c language-objective-c">var C = Object.keys(ObjectiveC.classes);
var soccer_classes = []; 
for (var i = 0; i &lt; C.length; i++)
   C[i].match(/soccer/i) &amp;&amp; soccer_classes.push( C[i] );</code></pre>
<p>It was a slow process.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3h52yk/someone_discovered_that_the_facebook_ios/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discovered</a> that Facebook Messenger has a very large number of classes.</p>
<p>But, in the end, I got a small list.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xiOhf1t00RNyXa_o8m7Hnw.png" alt="Output of the script" /></p>
<p>Once I obtained the class names, I used a script to print all methods of the class, and, by inspecting the <strong>MNSoccerGame</strong> class, the resulting methods were:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2606/1*VnA--gnGj5wO3ZcF4C8EUQ.png" alt="The methods dump of the MNSoccerGame class" /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I still don’t understand what is the method <code>wasCheatDetected.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that I had a complete list of the class methods, I decided to override the *_setScore *method, hoping that other methods didn’t notice that.</p>
<p>To do this, I used the <strong>MobileSubstrate</strong> and its <strong>MS.hookMessage</strong> method.</p>
<pre><code class="objective-c language-objective-c">@import com.saurik.substrate.MS; 

var _setScore_pointer = {}; 
MS.hookMessage(MNSoccerGame, @selector(_setScore:), function(arg0) {
      return _setScore_pointer-&gt;call(this, 9999); 
}, _setScore_pointer);</code></pre>
<p>Now you can just play, <strong>lose</strong>, and <strong>anyway score a new record.</strong></p>

<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h3>
<p>Never stop yourself. Always try and discover a new way to accomplish the same thing. I know, it’s just a game, but if you treat the problem you’re trying to solve like a challenge, you’ll get much more than the satisfaction of beating your friends.</p>
