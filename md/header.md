Hej! Flavio here.

I'm interested in cyber-security, cryptography and I have fun in building bots, vocal assistants, IOT devices.

In my free time I love to build stuff that solve everyday problems, and as soon I can I release them as OSS projects.

I tend to apply lot of math in order to create elegant and readable algorithms.

> One of the greatest satisfactions is to create something on your own; my best way to do it's by coding.
