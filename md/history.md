I'm currently working at Spotify, building the [Desktop App](https://www.spotify.com/download/other), the server and client of the [Web Player](https://open.spotify.com), and other several acquisition products like [the widgets](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets).

I started coding in high-school by studying algorithms and data structures in C and C++. In the meantime, I used to build simple apps using .NET technologies and experimenting with ancient Windows Mobile phones... and it immediately became my passion.

Specializing as a full-stack developer using classical PHP, learning Joomla, Magento and Wordpress, then I focused on building REST APIs using Laravel. During the mobile era, I developed a lot of iOS and Android apps using Appcelerator Titanium.

Before joining Spotify, I used Node.js as main backend language and I've built web apps with React & Redux and GraphQL. I also made some experience in IOT using Arduino and Raspberry PI boards.

I learned how micro-services ecosystems work and dig a bit into dev-ops by managing Docker containers, CI pipelines by building infrastructures in AWS.

> One of the greatest satisfactions is to create something on your own; my best way to do it's by coding.
