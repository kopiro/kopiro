<h2>Sr. Software Engineer @Spotify in Stockholm<br/> Cyber-security obsessed<br/> I've built a monkey AI<br/> I like RJ45 cables<br/> oh, I hate YAML</h2>
<p>Hey! I currently work at Spotify in the Stockholm HQ as Senior Software Engineer, building the <a href="https://open.spotify.com">Web Player</a> and the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/download/other">Desktop App</a>; other than several acquisition products like <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets">the widgets</a>.</p>
<p>I'm interested in cyber-security, cryptography and I have fun in building bots, vocal assistants, IOT devices and CLI utilities. In my free time I love to build stuff that solve everyday problems, and as soon I can I release them as OSS projects. In general, I tend to apply lot of math in order to create elegant and readable algorithms.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One of the greatest satisfactions is to create something on your own; my best way to do it's by coding.</p>

<p>I started coding in high-school by studying algorithms and data structures in C and C++. In the meantime, I used to build simple apps using .NET technologies and experimenting with ancient Windows Mobile phones… and it immediately became my passion.</p>
<p>Specializing as a full-stack developer using classical PHP, learning Joomla, Magento and Wordpress, then I focused on building REST APIs using Laravel. During the mobile era, I developed a lot of iOS and Android apps using Appcelerator Titanium and became a contributor to this awesome framework.</p>
<p>In the last few years, I used NodeJS as main backend language and I've built web apps with React &amp; Redux and GraphQL. I also made some experience in IOT using Arduino and Raspberry PI boards. I learned how micro-services ecosystems work and dig a bit into dev-ops by managing Docker containers, CI pipelines by building infrastructures in AWS.</p>
