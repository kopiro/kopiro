<p>Otto is a monkey plush that we found in a highway store during a trip with my girlfriend in February 2017.</p>
<p>Its ability, while being extremely cute, was to listen to you, then walk and repeat all things with a higher pitch.</p>
<p>My goal was to make it more powerful by transforming it into a vocal assistant.</p>

<p>This is the first part of a series about Otto.</p>
<p>Originally, it was composed by the following hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A motor connected to his legs for allowing him to walk</p></li>
<li><p>A simple, closed (for modifications), built-in board</p></li>
<li><p>A microphone and a speaker</p></li>
<li><p>A push button to start the listening phase</p></li>
<li><p>Four AA batteries</p></li>
<li><p>A switch to completely power off the circuit</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to replace all these things with fresh and <strong>programmable</strong> hardware.</p>
<p>The real challenge here was to find the rights components that fitted in the original enclosure. The available space wasn’t much, so every choice had to be done conscientiously.</p>
<h3>Base board</h3>
<p>The preferred hardware for this project are Raspberry PI boards.</p>
<p>They are tiny and powerful enough to allow developers to use a high-level programming language and built-in libraries without flashing the software every-time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can debug your application in a more comfortable environment.</p>
<p>The best hardware at the time was the Raspberry Pi Zero W. Launched at the end of February 2017, the Pi Zero W has all the functionality of the original Pi Zero but with added connectivity.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3888/1*PiGGkpQ-b6g5yj5wb1-fLQ.png" alt="Raspberry Pi Zero W" /><em>Raspberry Pi Zero W</em></p>
<p>The board was not enough for such a project, so I added additional hardware.</p>
<h3>Audio components</h3>
<p>To build a vocal assistant, we need audio components. The requirements for these components are, of course, a speaker and a microphone.</p>
<p>For the microphone, I tried a USB microphone. The problem with this accessory was that it was not as sensible as I wished. Furthermore, an additional USB hub was required to connect it.</p>
<p>Moreover, I couldn’t connect a raw speaker easily.</p>
<p>For this reason, I opted to buy an additional board that accomplished this task very well: <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-2-Mics-Pi-HAT-p-2874.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT</a>.</p>
<p>ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT is a dual-microphone expansion board for Raspberry Pi designed for AI and voice applications.</p>
<p>The board is developed based on WM8960, a low power stereo codec. There are 2 microphones on both sides of the board for collecting sounds. It also provides 3 APA102 RGB LEDs, 1 User Button, and 2 on-board Grove interfaces.</p>
<p>I did not plan to connect LEDs to my board, but the fact that this HAT has built-in LEDs made me think to use them.</p>

<p>Then I took an old Bluetooth mini-speaker, disassembled it, and connected it to the JST 2.0 Speaker Out port.</p>
<p>To make it work, you have to install their drivers on your board. Drivers are also used to control LEDs within your application via a standard protocol.</p>

<p><em>Hint: when you install a shield, all your GPIO pins are covered. It’s useful to know which pins are <strong>really used</strong> by your board. To accomplish that, use <a href="https://pinout.xyz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://pinout.xyz/</a></em></p>
<p>For example, for this board, check out this link: <a href="https://pinout.xyz/pinout/respeaker_2_mics_phat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://pinout.xyz/pinout/respeaker_2_mics_phat</a></p>
<h3>Powering the board</h3>
<p>The Raspberry Pi board can be easily powered via USB 5V input. The problem with this approach is that you have to buy a battery pack and connect it via USB.</p>
<p>I didn’t find any battery pack small enough to fit my plush, then my unique alternative was using LiPo batteries.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*47fQNM9dZmH2EbOlassALw.png" alt="LiPo Battery — 3.7V 2000mAh" /><em>LiPo Battery — 3.7V 2000mAh</em></p>
<p>You can’t connect your LiPo battery to your board, you have to use a converter. It can be powered by any 3.7V LiIon/LiPoly battery, and then it converts the battery output to 5.2V DC.</p>
<p>Initially, I bought a <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/lipo-shim" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LiPo SHIM</a>, but I didn’t notice that this controller provides power to your board without charging your batteries.</p>
<p>For this reason, I switched to <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/powerboost-500-charger-rechargeable-5v-lipo-usb-boost-500ma" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adafruit PowerBoost 500 Charger.</a>** It has a built-in battery charger circuit. You’ll be able to keep your project running even while charging the battery!</p>

<h3>Additional hardware</h3>
<p>The software uses the “hot-word” concept to start the interaction. Basically, it continuously listens for a hot-word, like “Hey Otto”, then you just talk and say commands.</p>
<p>For having an alternative method to start the interaction, I installed a** push-button **connected directly to the GPIO board, at the GPIO8 pin.</p>

<p>Now only one thing was missing: <strong>the power on-off switch.</strong></p>
<p>I connected this simple component to the PowerBoost Charger via its ENABLE port. The purpose of the ENABLE port is to disconnect the output completely.</p>
