> One of the greatest satisfactions is to create something on your own; my best way to do it's by coding.

I started in high-school by studying algorithms and data structures in C and C++. In the meantime, I used to build simple apps using .NET technologies and experimenting with ancient Windows Mobile phonesâ€¦ and it immediately became my passion.

Specializing as a full-stack developer using classical PHP, learning Wordpress and Joomla, I then focused on building APIs using Laravel. During the mobile era, I started to learn Appcelerator Titanium for cross-platform mobile apps and becoming a contributor to this framework.

In the last few years, I used NodeJS as the main backend language and built web apps with React, Redux, and GraphQL. I also made some experience in IOT with Arduino and Raspberry PI boards. I learned how micro-services ecosystems work and managed Docker containers, CI pipelines by building infrastructures in AWS.

Building bots, vocal assistants, CLI utilities and working with Unity in the free time, I love to build useful stuff that solves everyday problems, and as soon as I can I release open source project. In my work, I like to build stuff by applying a lot of math, very useful in WebGL and low-level graphics animations.
