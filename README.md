**Backend and Mobile Lead Developer for @Caffeina, Parma, IT.**

I started to learn how to code during high school, studying **algorithms** and **data structures** in C and C++. In the meantime, I used to build simple desktop apps using .NET... and it immediately became my **passion**.

Specializing as a **full-stack developer** using PHP and classical web technologies, I loved to build animations using canvas and javascript API. Then I focused on building REST backends using **PHP** and **Laravel**, and making some experience with high-scalable **Node.js** application and simple CLI utilities. During mobile era in 2015, I started to learn **Titanium** since 3.x release, becoming a core contributor of this framework.

I love to build useful stuffs that solves (my) everyday problems, and as soon as I can I release **Open Source** projects. [(yes, this website is also open source)](https://github.com/kopiro/kopiro)

I'm currently studying **cyber-security** and I used to do CTF competitions.

Known as **@kopiro**.
