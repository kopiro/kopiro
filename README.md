> One of the greatest satisfactions is to create something on your own; my best way to do it's by coding.

I started to learn how to code during high school, studying **algorithms** and **data structures** in C and C++. In the meantime, I used to build simple desktop apps using .NET technologies... and it immediately became my **passion**.

Specializing as a **Full-stack Developer** using classical PHP, I loved to build animations using JS Canvas API.

During mobile era in 2015, I started to learn **Titanium** since 3.x release, becoming a contributor; and I made some experience in IOT with **Arduino** and **Raspberry PI** boards.

Then, I focused on building APIs using **PHP** and **Laravel**, and making some experience with **Node.js** web application with **React**, building **bots**, **vocal assistants** and simple CLI utilities.

I love to build useful stuff that solves (my) everyday problems, and as soon as I can I release **open source** projects.

I'm currently studying **cyber-security** and I used to do CTF competitions.

Known as **@kopiro**.
