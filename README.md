## Flavio De Stefano

Hello, I'm Flavio.

I studied computer engineering and I'm currently a Backend and Mobile coordinator for Caffeina in Parma, Italy.

I started to learn how to code at 16 (C, C++ and .NET), and soon it became my passion, not just my work.

I specialized as full-stack developer using PHP + classical web techs as main technologies.

After that, I specialized building API using Laravel and making some experience with NodeJS applications.

Using MySQL for DBMS most of the time, I have also Oracle and MongoDB knowledge.

For mobile apps, I started to learn Titanium since 3.x release, becoming a core contributor of this awesome framework.

I usally build project with security in mind and I do a full pen-testing; in the free time I usally play CTF competitions.

I actively contribute to open source projects, view my [public activity](https://github.com/kopiro?tab=activity).

I believe that one of the greatest satisfactions in this life is to create something on your own,
and my best way to do so is by coding.
