### Sr. Software Engineer @Spotify in Stockholm üá∏üá™<br/>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cyber-security obsessed<br/>ü§ñ I've built a monkey AI<br/>üì† I like RJ45 cables<br/>üìÉ oh, I hate YAML

Hey! I currently work at Spotify in the Stockholm HQ as Senior Software Engineer, building the [Web Player](https://open.spotify.com) and the [Desktop App](https://www.spotify.com/download/other); other than several acquisition products like [the widgets](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets).

I'm interested in cyber-security, cryptography and I have fun in building bots, vocal assistants, IOT devices and CLI utilities. In my free time I love to build stuff that solve everyday problems, and as soon I can I release them as OSS projects. In general, I tend to apply lot of math in order to create elegant and readable algorithms.

> One of the greatest satisfactions is to create something on your own; my best way to do it's by coding.

## me
I started coding in high-school by studying algorithms and data structures in C and C++. In the meantime, I used to build simple apps using .NET technologies and experimenting with ancient Windows Mobile phones... and it immediately became my passion.

Specializing as a full-stack developer using classical PHP, learning Joomla, Magento and Wordpress, then I focused on building REST APIs using Laravel. During the mobile era, I developed a lot of iOS and Android apps using Appcelerator Titanium and became a contributor to this awesome framework.

In the last few years, I used NodeJS as main backend language and I've built web apps with React & Redux and GraphQL. I also made some experience in IOT using Arduino and Raspberry PI boards. I learned how micro-services ecosystems work and dig a bit into dev-ops by managing Docker containers, CI pipelines by building infrastructures in AWS.
