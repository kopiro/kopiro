## Flavio De Stefano

Hello,
I studied computer engineering and I work as a developer for Caffeina in Parma, Italy.

I started to learn how to code at 16 (C, C++ and .NET), and soon it became my passion, not just my work.

I started as a full-stack developer using PHP + classical web techs (HTML + JS + CSS) as main technologies,
studying at the same time the canvas JS API to make beautiful and low-level animations.

After that, I specialized building API using Laravel and making some experience with high-scalable Node.js application,
other than simple CLI scripts.

Then I started to learn Titanium since 3.x release, becoming a core contributor of this awesome framework.

I actively contribute to open source projects, view my [public activity](https://github.com/kopiro?tab=activity).

The project of which I am most proud of is [Trimethyl](https://github.com/caffeinalab/trimethyl), an open-source Titanium toolchain.

I believe that one of the greatest satisfactions in this life is to create something on your own,
and my best way to do so is by coding.
